# Chapter 3 Simulation

Before run `main.py`, you should install the mmdetection from the chap3-exper branch.

`main.py` determines the number of processes based on `os.cpu_count`.

Simulation results are saved in the output folder. The positions of 5000 random points are saved in `preds_center.txt`.

`plot3d.m` is a MATLAB script, used to plot the error distribution map.
